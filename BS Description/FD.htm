This bad smell is the result of experienced, non-object-oriented developers who design and implement an application in an object-oriented environment. When developers are comfortable with a "main" routine that calls numerous subroutines, they may tend to make every subroutine a class, ignoring class hierarchy altogether.

In the scatterplot, red dot represents class with functional decomposition <div class="redbox" style="width:14px; height: 12px; margin: 1px; background: #FF0000; display: inline-block;"></div>.
The reason why a class is classified as functional decomposition lies with high values of respective metrics (number of public methods and weighted method per class). Blue dot depicts class with no functional decomposition <div class="bluebox" style="width:14px; height: 12px; margin: 1px; background: #4682b4; display: inline-block;"></div>.

If the class has a single method, a remedy can be to model the class as part of an existing class. Classes designed as helper classes to another class are better off being combined into the base class they assist.
