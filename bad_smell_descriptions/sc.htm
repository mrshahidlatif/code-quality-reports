Spaghetti Code appears as a program or system that contains very little software structure. If developed using an object-oriented language, the software may include a small number of objects that contain methods with very large implementations that invoke a single, multistage process flow.

In the scatterplot, spaghetti code is represented in red dot <div class="redbox" style="width:14px; height: 12px; margin: 1px; background: #FF0000; display: inline-block;"></div>.
The identification of spaghetti code comes from high values of respective metric (average method complexity). Blue dot represents class <div class="bluebox" style="width:14px; height: 12px; margin: 1px; background: #4682b4; display: inline-block;"></div> free of spaghetti code .

A couple of steps can be taken to remove spaghetti code. First, gain abstract access to member variables of a class using accessor functions, and then convert a code segment into a function.
