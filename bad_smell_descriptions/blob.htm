<p>The Blob is found in designs where one class monopolizes the processing, and other classes primarily encapsulate data. The main problem with such design is that the majority of the responsibilities are allocated to a single class.</p>
<!--p>In the scatterplot, red dot represents class with blob <div class="redbox" style="width:14px; height: 12px; margin: 1px; background: #FF0000; display: inline-block;"></div>.
The reason why a class is classified as a blob lies with high values of respective metrics (lines of code, weighted method per class, and average method complexity). Blue dot shows blob-free class <div class="bluebox" style="width:14px; height: 12px; margin: 1px; background: #4682b4; display: inline-block;"></div>.</p-->
<p>A possible refactoring is to identify or categorize related attributes and operations according to contracts. These contracts should be cohesive in that they all directly relate to a common focus, behavior, or function within the overall system.</p>
